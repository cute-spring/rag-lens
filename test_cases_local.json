Data-Driven Learning**\n- Algorithms learn from examples rather than explicit programming\n- Quality and quantity of training data directly impact performance\n- Requires representative datasets that capture the problem space\n\n**2. Pattern Recognition**\n- Identifies underlying patterns in complex datasets\n- Uses statistical methods to find correlations and relationships\n- Enables prediction and classification tasks\n\n**3. Generalization**\n- Ability to apply learned patterns to new, unseen data\n- Critical for real-world deployment\n- Measured through validation and testing metrics",
